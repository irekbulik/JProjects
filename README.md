# JProjects

Small J projects to play on the phone 

  * implementation of unrestricted hartree fock for 1D hubbard model
     - can be run on iPone; it links agains iOS math library
     - solve (number of sites;U;number of electrons) 
	- 0 } solve (200;4;200)   : energy _0.469105, 23 cycles 
     - super fast :) 
	-  6!:2 'solve (400;4;400)'   9.58s 
     - the guess is pure antifero, so while you can run dopped system, it probably wont converge
     - on my iPhone, I added band structure analysis, but it is not here 
     
  * ulam spiral, inspired by youtube video
